            Previously, I received my Masters degree from <a
            href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en">Waseda University</a>, and did
            an internship at <a
            href="https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/">Preferred
            Networks</a>. In this blog, I write about my interests in
            machine learning, software development, and research.
