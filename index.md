        <p>Hi, I'm Priyanka Kukreja and welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>
            I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Facebook. My work helps people
            discover the products they love on FB Marketplace and IG Shopping.

            Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science
            from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>,
            and did an internship at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">
            GoDaddy</a>, where I predicted the price of a domain name.

            In this blog, I write about my interests in software engineering
            and building ML @ scale.
