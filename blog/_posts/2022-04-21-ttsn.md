Two-tower Sparse neural network (or TTSN for short) is a NN architecture that consists of two separate branches or "towers" of layers. Each tower processes a different type of input, and the outputs from each tower are then combined in some way to produce the final output.

The term "sparse" is often used in ML to refer to models that have a large number of parameters but only a relatively small number of active (non-zero) parameters at any given time. See [this](https://priyankakukreja267.github.io/blog/2022/04/18/sparsenn/) for more info. 

### Applications
TTSN has a wide range of applications in various fields. Here are some examples:

1. Recommendation systems: Two-tower neural networks can be used to build recommendation systems that suggest products, services, or content to users based on their past behavior or preferences. In this case, one tower can represent the user, while the other tower represents the item being recommended.

2. Natural language processing: Two-tower neural networks can also be used for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and named entity recognition. For example, one tower can represent the input text, while the other tower represents the context or task.

3. Computer vision: Two-tower neural networks are often used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In this case, one tower can represent the image features, while the other tower represents the object class or category.

4. Fraud detection: Two-tower neural networks can also be used to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud, insurance fraud, or cyber attacks. One tower can represent the user behavior, while the other tower represents the historical patterns of fraudulent behavior.

Overall, the two-tower sparse neural network is a powerful and flexible architecture that can be applied to a wide range of tasks in various domains.
